# Carna package Template

The template covers the following use cases:

| Type          | Description                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Application` | The package is not published on NPM and runs directly, e.g. as a Docker container |
| `Library`     | The package is a library that is published on NPM, for example                    |
| `CLI`         | The package is like a library, but with one executable file                       |
| `Monorepo`    | This is a collection of different packages in one repository                      |

Depending on which scenario has been selected, the following adjustment must still be made.
Regardless of the selection, the points under `Special Settings` must still be made.

```bash
rm -rf ./.github/workflows/release.yml ./.releaserc.json

  "workspaces": {}
}
```

  "workspaces": {}
}
```

## ðŸ§¬ - Monoreepo

There is a prepared package for each of the above types, these can be taken depending on the scenario...

Delete the following folders or files:

```bash
rm -rf ./.github/workflows/release.yml ./.releaserc.json
rm -rf ./src ./tests
rm -rf ./.env # if no "app" is built
```

  "bugs": {},
  "publishConfig": {},
  "scripts.start": "",
  "scripts.dev": ""
}
```

## ðŸ’‰ - Special Settings

The `jest.config.js` must still be customized.
For a single repository the monorepo entries have to be deleted and for a monorepo the single repository entries have to be deleted. When extending a monorepo (new package) the corresponding entries have to be added.

### Project variables

Replace the following variable in the project with the respective values:

| Key                | Description                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `package-name`     | Package name                                       |
| `package-name-app` | Package name from package-app (only with monorepo) |
| `package-name-cli` | Package name from package-cli (only with monorepo) |
| `package-name-lib` | Package name from package-lib (only with monorepo) |
| `kettil`           | Github username (from the URL)                     |
| `github-repo`      | Github repository (from the URL)                   |

The following values can or should be adjusted in the `package.json`:

```json
{
  "description": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "author": "name <email>",
  "keywords": [],
  "engines": {},
  "private": true
}
```

If the package is to be published, e.g. at NPM, then the key `private` must be set to `false`.

Delete the following folders or files:

```bash
rm -rf .github
```

Delete the following keys in **all** `package.json` with the subvalues:

```json
{
  "repository": {},
  "bugs": {}
}
